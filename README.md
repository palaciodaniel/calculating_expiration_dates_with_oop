# Calculating Expiration Dates with OOP (Object Oriented Programming)

The idea of preparing a project that involved Object Oriented Programming was something that I wanted to do since a long time ago, and despite being a challenging task, the most difficult part was actually thinking on an idea that felt organic for the subject. Sure, I had the option to showcase the finished projects that I had to complete to get one of my Sololearn certifications, but I do not think that spoiling those solutions would be something appropriate, for obvious reasons.

In the beginning, it was going to be only a single class, but after thinking about perishable products, then the idea of applying inheritance came immediately to my mind, and after seeing the final result I must confess that I am really glad on how everything turned out.

And even more: since the core premise involves dates, it was also an excellent opportunity to use the _datetime_ library, which until this point I have never used on a repository before.
